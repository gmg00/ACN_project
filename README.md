## Abstract
The concept of the "metaverse," first introduced by Neal Stephenson in 1992, has transformed social and economic interactions through virtual platforms such as Decentraland. This study adopts a multilayer network analysis approach to investigate how spatial proximity, exchange similarities (reflected through shared NFT ownership), and out-of-game behaviors intersect to shape the social and economic networks of Decentraland users.
Three primary objectives were defined, firstly examine the relationship between spatial proximity and user similarities; secondly explore whether in-game similarities are correlated with interactions beyond the platform; and thirdly inspect the potential correlation between spatial proximity within the Decentraland environment and transactions occurring outside the platform.
Using datasets that capture user positions and blockchain transaction details, a three-layer multilayer network was constructed, consisting of spatial interactions, in-game collectibles similarities, and external transactions.
Edge overlap ratio and correlation analysis highlight a potential interconnection between virtual and real-world activities, driving forward further exploration of social and exchange dynamics in the metaverse.
